# Boston Housing Prices Prediction Capstone Project

## How to run

1. Open [process-data.ipynb](./process_data/process-data.ipynb)
   and [Boston_Housing_trees.ipynb](./model/BostonHousingPricePrediction.ipynb) in Google Collab or Jupyter
   Notebook.
2. Run `process-data.ipynb` before `Boston_Housing_trees.ipynb`. You do not need to upload the dataset since it is
   already loaded in `scikit-learn` library.
